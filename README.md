# Starred

Play a victory fanfare when your repositories get starred on GitHub.

## Usage

```bash
$ starred hyperoslo/Form hyperoslo/Sync
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install starred
```

## Dependencies

Starred spawns `afplay` to play the fanfare, so you'll need that. It's bundled with Mac OS X, but if
you're on Linux you'll need to [get your hands dirty](https://github.com/jgorset/starred/blob/290928c749f85b6e8ca989f5c0fbd0c60112d336/starred.js#L51).

## I love you

Johannes Gorset made this. You should [tweet me](http://twitter.com/jgorset) if you can't get it
to work. In fact, you should tweet me anyway.

## I love Hyper

I work at [Hyper](http://hyper.no) with a bunch of awesome folks who are all every bit as passionate
about making things as I am. If you're using this application, we probably want to hire you.
