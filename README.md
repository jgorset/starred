## I love you

Johannes Gorset made this. You should [tweet me](http://twitter.com/jgorset) if you can't get it
to work. In fact, you should tweet me anyway.

## I love Hyper

I work at [Hyper](http://hyper.no) with a bunch of awesome folks who are all every bit as passionate
about making things as I am. If you're using this application, we probably want to hire you.
